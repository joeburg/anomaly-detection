# FAQ

Here are some common questions we've received. If you have additional questions, please email us at `cc@insightdataengineering.com` and we'll answer your questions as quickly as we can (during PST business hours), and update this FAQ.

### How to calculate mean and standard deviation?

For this challenge, an anomalous amount is defined as a value that exceeds `mean + (3*sd)`

For simplicity, we can assume that the mean and standard deviation of the purchase amounts can be calculated based on the formulas below:

where N is the number of purchases and x is the amount.

### Which Github link should I submit?
You should submit the URL for the top-level root of your repository. For example, this repo would be submitted by copying the URL `https://github.com/InsightDataScience/anomaly_detection` into the appropriate field on the application. **Do NOT try to submit your coding challenge using a pull request**, which would make your source code publicly available.
